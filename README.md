Trip Based Modeling of Fuel Consumption in Modern Fleet Vehicles Using Machine Learning

1. Ability to model and predict the fuel consumption is vital in enhancing fuel economy of vehicles and preventing fraudulent activities in fleet management. Fuel consumption of a vehicle depends on several internal & external factors However, not all these factors may be measured or available for the fuel consumption analysis.

2. The main aim of the project is to build Machine Learning  algorithm to predict the fuel consumption of  fleet vehicles based on the gas type, A web application is built which is integrated with ML Model.
